# CLAVENET: Generating Afro-Cuban Drum Patterns through Data Augmentation

ClaveNet is generative MIDI model for Afro-Cuban percussion. ClaveNet is the culmination of a project seeking to overcome the scarcity of Afro-Cuban MIDI drum data in publicly-available-datasets for the training of a cocreative, generative percussive model. We trained ClaveNet with the help of a novel data augmentation scheme that infuses Afro-Cuban drum patterns into a MIDI percussion dataset.

This repo houses subrepos housing a number of objects, functions, and scripts integral to the design and implementation of ClaveNet.
